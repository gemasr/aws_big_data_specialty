## General Overview of Amazon Kinesis Streams

* Collect and process large streams of data in real time
* Create data-processing applications
  * Read from streams
  * Process records
    * Send to a dashboard
    * Generate alerts
    * Take decisitions according to data etc..
* The typical scenarios for Kinesis streams could be:
  * Fast logs and data feed intake and processing
  * Real time metrics and reporting
  * Reak time data analytics
  * Complex stream processing
* The benefits of Kinesis are:
  * Real time aggregation of data
  * Loading data into a data warehouse or map reducer cluster
  * Durability and Elasticity
  * Parallel application readers
* In order to load or get data from Kinesis streams we have several options:
  * Kinesis producer Library (KPL)
  * Kinesis client Library (KCL)
  * Kinsesis Agent (To send and collect data)
